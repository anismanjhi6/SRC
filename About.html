<p>The Student Research Convention is being organised by the ARC (Academics and Research Cell, IIT Kanpur).  As a student body aimed at promoting student-based research at IIT Kanpur, ARC is dedicated towards bringing closer enthusiastic student members of the institute that have disparate experience and exposures in their fields of interest. Moreover, in this spirit, such an interaction could be even more fruitful if a platform is created for student researchers of our country to present their work to each other. 
</p>
<p>Hence, it is of our interest to be able to create an event where our senior researchers and students may be able to showcase their current research work to younger students of our institute, as well as interact and mingle to nurture the seeds of innovation in this country. Our key goals stand to be the following.
</p>
<p>There is currently no available platform for original student research in the country at the level of bachelor and master students. We wish to provide a stage to motivated students for presenting their work. This could benefit and motivate undergraduates and masters students from all over the country.
</p>
<p>Showcasing the research potential of institute to the emerging students of our country and hence promoting the inclination of students from other institutes towards research.
</p>
<p>Providing a platform for students from different areas/branches to interact and know about the work of young scientists going on within the country.
</p>
<p>Providing an opportunity for students to present and share their research experiences through oral and poster presentations thereby enlightening the participants about the process involved.
</p>
<p>Exhibiting and disseminating acumen of various clubs, groups and labs at IITK.
