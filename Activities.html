<p>Student Research Convention promises to deliver some very good research workshops during the event. We aim to present quality content through invited speakers from professors from renowned speakers in multiple domains. The content, due to its strong relevance to the technical and non-technical issues faced by students pursuing research will prove to be very useful for the audiences of the different backgrounds.The Student Research Convention is being organised by the ARC (Academics and Research Cell, IIT Kanpur).  As a student body aimed at promoting student-based research at IIT Kanpur, ARC is dedicated towards bringing closer enthusiastic student members of the institute that have disparate experience and exposures in their fields of interest. Moreover, in this spirit, such an interaction could be even more fruitful if a platform is created for student researchers of our country to present their work to each other. 
</p>
<p>The exact details of the workshops are to be announced below. The exact details will be announced soon.
</p>
	<p>Technical Workshops</p>
		<p>We plan to conduct specific topic based skill development workshops on hot research topics like Machine Learning Theory, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Finite Analysis, Advanced Linear Algebra, Data Analysis etc. These would present students with condensed application based content which would enable students to initiate research work in their respective domains. 
		</p>
		<p>The final topics of the workshops will be declared based on interests of the participating members.
		</p>
	<p>Talks</p>
		<p>Eminent researchers from multiple disciplines will be speaking in this event. More details coming soon!</p>
	<p>Exhibitional Workshops</p>	
		<p>The plan is to showcase the level of research exhibited by different groups, the local industrialists, the young startups and our very own clubs. We plan to invite the local industries who are doing excellent work in their respective fields. We will also invite our very own clubs from Student Gymkhana and our department research labs to exhibit their achievements and excellence. We also plan to invite talks by rural technological startups and some of the startups incubated in SIDBI (the startup incubation center of IIT Kanpur). 
		</p>
	<p>Non-Technical Workshops</p>
		<p>These workshops shall aim to improve the soft skills that are required for pursuing research activities. The workshops that we are intending to organise are :</p>
			<p>Workshop on how to write a good research paper: Often a student who starts to write his/her research paper faces trouble in figuring out how to write the paper effectively, so we will be organising a workshop that is pivoted on providing the guidelines regarding how to write an effective research paper. 
			</p>
			<p>Workshop on how to be a good presenter: This will focus on providing the right direction on how to present the ideas in most efficacious way.
			</p>
			<p>Workshop on designing: Through this we seek to introduce students to the softwares and technology that can be helpful during research. For  instance, Introduction to the LateX, Publisher can be provided, which can be helpful for designing posters and writing research papers.
			</p>
			<p>Workshop on Research ethics: This workshop will provide more general outline of what are the ethics to be followed during research.
			</p>
	<p>Panel Discussions</p>
		<p>We plan to conduct panel discussions for debating over the various problems and lack of proper technology at the industry and grass root level. There will be invited talks to discuss about the general state of research and development in India on issues, like what and where is it lacking behind the other countries. This will be the basis that will lead to re-initiate the Industrial Learning Program in IIT Kanpur, formerly known as PoWER.
		</p>
	<p>Miscellaneous</p>
		</p>We plan to conduct research-oriented workshops to motivate students for pursuing a career in research. It is always tough for an undergraduate student to decide if he wants to pursue a career in research or not. Through these talks, we hope to help the students to overcome some of these worries. These sessions will also have invited speakers who will explain why a student should pursue a PhD and about a student’s life before, during and after a PhD. We also plan to invite people who could counsel students about how to plan a research career,  what type of internships to look for and how to improve chances of getting into a good university. A talk shall be organized to explain the PhD application procedure to the students.
		</p>
		<p>The final lecture series will be decided based on participation responses.</p>
	<p>Presentations</p>
		<p>We plan to have research presentations at the level of undergraduate and master’s students. Student researchers from all over India are invited to submit their presentations for the conference. Interested people are invited to please visit the Presentations(Put a url to presentations here)  section.
